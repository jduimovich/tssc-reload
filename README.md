# tssc-reload


Quickly repopulate your RHDH with previously generate apps

Import the `https://github.com/jduimovich/tssc-reload/blob/main/reload.yaml ` 

Run the `https://github.com/jduimovich/tssc-reload/blob/main/reinstall-apps` to reinstall the apps in an RHTAP instance

You will have your pre-created apps and they will be running.
Great for testing the plugins, pipelines and now have to re-run the Template creation process.
